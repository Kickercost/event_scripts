## Simple rules

1. Find an issue you like and assign it to yourself.
2. Ask any questions you might have.
3. Post what language/framework you might do it in for a quick review. We'll accept a lot, but its to make sure its maintainable.
4. Fork/branch, whatever.
5. Do your work. Please remember to add something like a README.md on how to install dependencies and run the script.
6. Pull Request in
7. Merge
8. Get thanks for helping! :)
